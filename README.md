Simple Python Calculator
This is a basic Python script that performs simple arithmetic operations â€” addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division â€” based on user input.

ðŸ“‹ Features
Accepts two numbers from the user.

Accepts an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, or /).

Performs the selected operation and displays the result.

Handles invalid operation input gracefully.

ðŸ§® How It Works
The user is prompted to enter the first number.

The user is prompted to enter the second number.

The user is asked to input an operation sign (+, -, *, or /).

Based on the input, the program performs the calculation and prints the result.

ðŸ’» Sample Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
enter the first number: 10  
enter the second number: 5  
Enter a mathematical operation(+,-,* or /): *  
The product is: 50.0
ðŸš¨ Input Validation
If the user inputs an invalid operator (e.g., %, ^), the script will output:
"Enter a valid operation"
